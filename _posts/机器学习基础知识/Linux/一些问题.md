1. 运行 python test.py 会出现以下问题

`OMP: Error #15: Initializing libiomp5.so, but found libiomp5.so already initialized.
OMP: Hint: This means that multiple copies of the OpenMP runtime have been linked into the program. That is dangerous, since it can degrade performance or cause incorrect results. The best thing to do is to ensure that only a single OpenMP runtime is linked into the process, e.g. by avoiding static linking of the OpenMP runtime in any library. As an unsafe, unsupported, undocumented workaround you can set the environment variable KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE to allow the program to continue to execute, but that may cause crashes or silently produce incorrect results. For more information, please see http://www.intel.com/software/products/support/.
Aborted`

解决：

​	文件加入

```
	import os
	os.environ['KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK']='True'
```

2. 出现：`tensorflow之Your CPU supports instructions that this TensorFlow binary was not compiled to use: AVX2`
